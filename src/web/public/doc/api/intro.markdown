# Overview
GatewayScript is an extensible programming model on top of the familiar and friendly ECMAScript
(JavaScript) programming language. The GatewayScript feature has been architected to provide simple
access to all aspects of a network transaction. Never has it been easier to interrogate and
manipulate the contents of requests and responses.

The feature revolves around the GatewayScript Action. The GatewayScript Action simply contains the
GatewayScript file. When the GatewayScript Action executes, the file is retrieved, compiled, and
executed. The generated object code is then cached for future executions.
